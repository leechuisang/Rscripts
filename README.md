# Rscripts
# Coding Etiquette for RStudio:

# ==== 1 Organising Code into Sections ====
# Use two hashtags or a comment with four - or = signs at the end to create a section

# ==== 2 Structured ====
# Either for your own bad memory or for sharing with others
# try to include an Intro (authors, purpose of script etc.);
# libraries used (comment on what each library is used for);
# if functions are written by yourself or others, include;
# setting the working directory for Windows or Linux users;
# information on the input files and what data to extract;
# the different sections of your analysis in a logical path;
# the output of your analysis (choose flexible output formats
# such as .png pr .pdf for graphs, .csv for datasets etc.).

# ==== 3 Syntax ====
# Save your scripts as meaningful names and purpose
#
