## The function c() is used to create a non-recursive list which can contain named values
## For creating facet labels a quick way to rename the groups can be used using:

# Given a dataset where my_data$Days contains numbers 1 to 7
# facet_wrap(~Days) will result in graphs being named "1" to "7"

# Append the word "Day" before day numbers to create new labels
facet_labs <- paste("Day", unique(my_data$Days))
# OR if using stringr
facet_labs <- str_c("Day", unique(my_data$Days), sep=" ")

# Name each point of the dataset with the $Day alone
names(facet_labs) <- c(unique(my_data$Day))
