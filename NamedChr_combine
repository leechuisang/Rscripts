## The function c() is used to create a non-recursive list which can contain named values
## For creating facet labels a quick way to rename the groups can be used by
## creating new labels first, then naming the value with the old label

# Given a dataset where my_data$Days contains numbers 1 to 7
# facet_wrap(~Days) will result in graphs being named "1" to "7"

# Append the word "Day" before day numbers to create new labels
facet_labs <- paste("Day", unique(my_data$Days))
# OR if using stringr
facet_labs <- str_c("Day", unique(my_data$Days), sep=" ")

# Name each point of the dataset with the old label
names(facet_labs) <- c(unique(my_data$Day))

# Examples of manually adding new labels
facet_labs <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
[1] "Monday"    "Tuesday"   "Wednesday" "Thursday"  "Friday"    "Saturday"  "Sunday"

facet_labs <- paste("Weekday", c(1:5)) %>% c(paste("Weekend", 1:2))
[1] "Weekday 1" "Weekday 2" "Weekday 3" "Weekday 4" "Weekday 5" "Weekend 1" "Weekend 2"

names(facet_labs) <- c(unique(my_data$Day))
